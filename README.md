Before running, navigate to the project directory and install Bootstrap, React Router, and reactstrap:

### `npm install --save bootstrap react-router-dom reactstrap`

To start the project, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The [http://localhost:3000/manager/users](http://localhost:3000/manager/users) and [http://localhost:3000/manager/posts](http://localhost:3000/manager/posts) pages are designed to test displaying requested user/post content to the webpage. Use these webpages and modify the UserList.js and PostList.js files to request the proper endpoints to our backend. Any other requests we want to demo can have their responses printed to the console, nothing fancy-shmancy like what was done for the users and posts.
